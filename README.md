# Description: I developed this piece of software only for educational purposes, I wanted to improve my trojan coding skills, only to understand better the field of trojan programming.
# License: I do not allow to make any modifications in my software and I also deny the commercial use of it, however, I allow to publish a review on YouTube about this software, but remember to credit me!
# Installation:

1. git clone https://github.com/SegYT/DimonDRAT
2. cd DimonDRAT
3. chmod +x main.py
4. ./main.py
5. for the client you can play with packaging and convert it to an executable using py2exe or converting it directly to apk using kivy bulldozer, see tutorials on how to conver to apk.
6. Enjoy the remote access!

# Planning to add:

1. Reverse shell (Added)
2. Download and Upload files (Added, but not an internal function. Can be done via powershell in Windows or in Linux with wget or curl. More info here: https://superuser.com/questions/25538/how-to-download-files-from-command-line-in-windows-like-wget-or-curl. Also you can upload and download using ftp. More information here: https://superuser.com/questions/253245/how-do-i-upload-files-using-the-command-line-on-windows)
3. Webcam Snap (Removed)
4. Remote desktop (Added)
5. Webcam Live Stream (Added)
6. Quick setup (Can be done via WinRAR)
7. Compile the client to DLL (Useless, so removed)
8. Option to automatically inject it into any process (Removed, as you can build the py file into a similar system process, for example, svchost)
9. Absolute stealth mode (You need to obfuscate the file test.py and absolutely no antivirus will detect it)

Contact me on Discord if you have a problem or if you want to contribute with me to finish my software, support will be appreciated!
